# Code Challenge 10 - Stacks and Queues

Create a Stack class with push, pop, peek, is_empty methods

Create a Queue class with enqueue, dequeue, peek, is_empty methods

## Whiteboard Process

No whiteboard required

## Approach & Efficiency

Used node-based implementation to create both stack and queue.

Stack uses one pointer for the top.

Queue uses two pointers for front and back.

Efficiency:

O(1) time efficiency, as we do not need to traverse to perform any actions.

O(1) space efficiency, as no other data structures are created.

## Solution

Run from python directory:

run python data_structures/stack.py

run python data_structures/queue.py

To test, run pytest from python directory
